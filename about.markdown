I’m a software engineer with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Software Engineering from UNSW Sydney. I design and deliver cloud-native products end-to-end, running workloads on AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3) provisioned with Terraform and deployed through GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. I have also led hands-on LLM fine-tuning experience for UNSW’s AI Conversational Simulation Project.
